            <p>As a completely volunteer-run organisation, Speedcubing New Zealand relies on volunteers to run competitions, manage our social media presence and make major decisions.</p>
            <p>We always need new volunteers to fill a variety of roles! You can view our current vacancies at the bottom of this page.</p>

            <h3>Volunteering opportunities</h3>
            <p>As per our <a href="about_us.html">About</a> page, SNZ's staff are split into 3 different groups: WCA Delegates, SNZ Promotional Team and SNZ Governance. For more information on their roles, click <a href="about_us.html">here</a>.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>Volunteering at competitions</h4>
                <p>In addition to our listed SNZ staff, we always need people to perform staffing duties at <a href="competitions.html">competitions</a>, including but not limited to running, judging and scrambling duties. If you are a trusted person (as decided by the competition's WCA Delegates and organisers), you may be encouraged to do data entry (<a href="https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/" target="_blank">WCA Live</a>) duties.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Other opportunities to volunteer</h4>
                <p>We need staff to perform staffing duties outside of competitions as well. If you have experience with software developing and/or website design, you can view the issues lodged on GitHub pertaining to this website <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/prospective-SNZ-website/issues" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
