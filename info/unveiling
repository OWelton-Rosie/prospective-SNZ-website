Dear New Zealand speedcubing community,

Over the past few months, I have been developing a prospective SNZ website with the long-term aim of eventually having it implemented.

I have endeavoured to keep the style (mostly) consistent with the SNZ website's current styling, however, some minor inconsistencies are apparent. (I'll leave the user to find them.) 

If you notice a bug, send me a DM on Discord, lodge an issue on GitHub or make a pull request, and Iâ€™ll review it as soon as possible.


My prospective SNZ website can be found at: https://prospective-snz-website.pages.dev/
The GitHub repo tied to my prospective SNZ website can be found at: https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/prospective-SNZ-website.

Cheers,
Oscar (2023WELT02).
